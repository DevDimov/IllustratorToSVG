### Batch export Illustrator (.ai) documents as SVG

I wrote this script to help me export tens of Adobe Illustrator files into SVG format with a single click.

1. Download SaveAsSVG.jsx
2. Copy and paste the script in C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 2021\Presets\en_GB\Scripts
3. Open Adobe Illustrator and click on File > Scripts > SaveAsSVG
4. Select the folder with Illustrator files you want to convert to SVG
5. Enter the type of files to you want to process (*.ai) and press OK

All exported SVGs will be saved in the folder containing the Illustrator files.
